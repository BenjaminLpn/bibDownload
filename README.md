Download BibTex from Bing automatically.

### Introduction
* It is a time consuming to download BibTex from website manually, especially when we have downloaded the references.
This script aims at downloading from academic sources from website automatically.

* In current version, resources can be downloaded from Bing website.
* Actually, I failed to download from Google Scholar because the environment of my PyCharm and SublimeText cannot access proxy.

* Furthermore, I want to make a utilibility to search related works and collect their bibs together for better understanding of one research point.
